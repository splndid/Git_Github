2) touch chapter1.txt chapter2.txt chapter3.txt

3) vim chapter1.txt
   commands for vim:
        Open a file: vim [filename]
        Exit Vim: Esc -> :q or Esc -> :q! (force exit without saving)
        Save a file: Esc -> :w or :w [filename] or :w /path/to/newfile

5) ls -a
        list all files and directories in a directory, including hidden files and directories.
        By default, the ls command only lists non-hidden files and directories. Hidden files and 
        directories in Unix-based systems are denoted by a dot (.) before the filename, and 
        they are typically used for configuration files or files that are not meant to be viewed or modified by users.
        The -a option with ls stands for "all" and tells the command to show all files, including hidden ones. 
        So, running ls -a will display a list of all files and directories in the current directory, 
        including those that are normally hidden.

        Note that when using ls -a, you will often see two additional directories: '.' 
        and '..', . refers to the current directory, and .. refers to the parent directory.

6) git status
        git status is a command used in Git to show the current status of the repository.

        It tells you which branch you're on, which files have been modified or added, and which files are staged or 
        unstaged for the next commit.

7) 'git add .' 
        is a command used in Git to stage all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories for the next commit.

8) git commit -m "complete chapter 1"
9) git log       
        git log is a command used in Git to display a log of the commit history of a repository.
        commit f9c5a4cee36bc7658cfb9b9e566237bd4dfaf901 (HEAD -> master) (this hash-f9c5a4cee36bc7658cfb9b9e566237bd4dfaf901 uniquely identifies the commit)
