5) ls -a
        list all files and directories in a directory, including hidden files and directories.
        By default, the ls command only lists non-hidden files and directories. Hidden files and 
        directories in Unix-based systems are denoted by a dot (.) before the filename, and 
        they are typically used for configuration files or files that are not meant to be viewed or modified by users.
        The -a option with ls stands for "all" and tells the command to show all files, including hidden ones. 
        So, running ls -a will display a list of all files and directories in the current directory, 
        including those that are normally hidden.

        Note that when using ls -a, you will often see two additional directories: '.' 
        and '..', . refers to the current directory, and .. refers to the parent directory.

        unstaged for the next commit.
